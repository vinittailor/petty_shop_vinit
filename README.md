# petty_shop_vinit with Local Storage and Provider

This Flutter application showcases fetching random dog images from the https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random API, displaying them on the home page, storing viewed images locally, and adding images to a simulated cart with prices. It leverages Provider for state management and SQLite for local storage, providing a solid foundation for further development.

### Features:

* Fetches random dog images on demand.
* Displays the fetched image on the home page.
* Provides a button to fetch a new image.
* Stores previously viewed images in a local SQLite database.
* Offers a "History" page to view stored images.
* Implements a simulated cart functionality with the ability to add images and specify prices.
* Leverages Provider for state management and SQLite for local storage, demonstrating best practices for Flutter development.
